      a long drawn out conversation about why i should not go to highdown,after

      designateed Safeguarding Team. "If a parent has concerns about any child’s
      safety or well-being they should contact the school’s Safeguarding
      Officers immediately. All incidents will be investigated and if necessary
      outside agencies may be informed. You can email the safeguarding team at
      DSO@highdown.reading.sch.uk (not a 24-hour service) or phone the school on
      0118 901 5800 during the school day. If, at any point, there is a risk of
      immediate serious harm to a child, and the school is closed, you can call
      the Children's Single Point of Access [CSPoA] on 0118 9373641 (9am-5pm
      Monday to Friday). Outside these hours, contact the Emergency Duty Team on
      01344 786543. Alternatively, contact the Police on 101 or 999. Parentwise:
      this is a new resource provided by the Department for Education for
      parents/carers to identify a range of risks, online and offline, for young
      people; what signs to look out for; and for advice and guidance."
